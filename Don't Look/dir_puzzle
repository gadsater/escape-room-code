Many -> Less -> Any -> All -> More -> No -> Some -> Few

Oh! So you have come here... Where do you look, there are many direstories around...

So, You have eliminated a directory, huh! That makes it one less directory than before. I am just reminding where you are.

All directories are possibilities to lead to an answer that you are looking for, but any one can only choosen at a time.

Now, there is a chance that all directories might contain the answer.

* Add morse code jpg in this directory * Now you might believe that you have found the answer but there are more directories to look at. Do not be misguided!

A wise teacher once said "Something is better than nothing, but nothing is better than nonsense".

Though there are few directories left, exploring some more directories might give you the right answer.

There are only a few directories left (well just one!). So, go find your luck!

Haha! You thought I had an answer! Well, literally no but I can guide you to the answer. Trust me! Well, you have already seen it. All you need to do is go back to the beginning. You have travelled eight different cities to just find this! Before you reach the beginning, I would solve the number puzzle in my hand but I don't know about you. You want to know which puzzle I am solving... Well... Go dice off!!!
